1.3 (XXXX-XX-XX)
	o Updated README
    o Added GPL license text
	o Added this CHANGES file
	o Fixed bug in POL_KroneckerProduct (used by the examples)
	o Added Max Horn as addition package maintainer; removed outdated
	  email address for Bjoern Assmann and removed his maintainer flag
	  (at least for the time being, due to lack of time on his part)
	o Removed references to KANT / KASH -- which is a dependency of
	  (old versions of) Alnuth, so we should not have to worry about
	  it here.
	o Fixed handling of matrix groups over finite fields that are
	  not prime fields.
	o Changed IsSolvableGroup method installation so that calling them
	  on matrix groups not defined over a field does not cause weird
	  errors anymore.
	o Changed the IsPolycyclicMatGroup methods to IsPolycyclicGroup
	  methods, so that more code can automatically benefit from this
	  functionality. The only remaining IsPolycyclicMatGroup method
	  simply invokes IsPolycyclicGroup.
