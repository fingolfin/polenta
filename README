The GAP 4 package `Polenta'
========================

 
This package provides functions for the computation with matrix
groups. Let $G$ be a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where the ring $R$ is
either equal to $\Q,\Z$ or a finite field $\F_q$.
Then:
   - We can test whether $G$ is solvable.
   - If $G$ is polycyclic, then we can determine a polycyclic
    presentation for $G$.
    
A group $G$ which is given by a polycyclic presentations can be largely
investigated by algorithms implemented in the GAP-package
Polycyclic. For example
we can determine if $G$ is torsion-free
and calculate the torsion subgroup. Further we can compute the derived
series and the Hirschlength of the group $G$. Also various methods for
computations with subgroups, factorsgroups and extensions are
available.
 
In the case that the matrix group
$G$ is a subgroup of $GL(d,\F_q)$ or $GL(d,\Z)$, the
group $G$ is solvable if and only if $G$ is polycyclic.
Therefore, in this case, we can test if $G$ is polycyclic.
 
As a by-product, the Polenta package
provides some functionality to compute certain module series for
modules of solvable groups. For example, if
$G$ is a rational polycyclic matrix group, then we can compute the
radical series of the natural
$\Q[G]$-module $\Q^d$.

The GAP-Packages Alnuth and Polycyclic are needed for this package.

Installing this package
=======================

This package is available at 

      http://cayley.math.nat.tu-bs.de/software/assmann/Polenta
     
in form of a gzipped tar-archive and as an uncompressed tar-archive.

There are two ways of installing the package.  If you have permission
to add files to the installation of GAP 4 on your system you may
install the Polenta package into the pkg subdirectory of the GAP
installation tree.  If you do not have the permission to do that you
may install the Polenta package in your private area.

--  Installation in the GAP 4 pkg subdirectory on a Unix system.

    We assume that the archive file polenta.tar.gz or polenta.tar is
    present in pkg and that the current directory is pkg.  All that needs
    to be done is to unpack the archive.

    bash> tar xfz polenta.tar.gz        # for the gzipped tar-archive
    bash> tar xf polenta.tar            # for the uncompressed tar-archive
    bash> gap4
    [... startup messages ...]
    gap> RequirePackage("polenta");
    true
    gap>     

--  Installation in a private directory

    We assume that we are in a directory called  <mygap>  which also
    contains the archive file of the Polenta package.

    bash> mkdir pkg
    bash> mv polenta.tar.gz pkg
    bash> tar xfz polenta.tar.gz


    When you start GAP 4 you have to use the option -l in the
    following manner:

    gap4 -l ";<mygap>"

    Note the semicolon!  It is imortant to have it there.  The effect
    is that the directory <mygap> is appended to the list of
    directories which GAP searches for input data.  Note that you do
    not say <mygap>/pkg.
