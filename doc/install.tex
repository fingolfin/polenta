The installation of the {\Polenta} package follows standard {\GAP} rules.
So the standard method is to unpack	 the package into the `pkg'
directory  of your {\GAP} distribution.  This will create an `polenta'
subdirectory. 

For other non-standard options please see  Chapter~"ref:Installing a
GAP Package" in the {\GAP} Reference Manual.

%To create the documentation, go into the `doc' directory and type
%`make_doc'.

To use the {\Polenta} Package you have to request it explicitly. 
This  can be 
done by `LoadPackage("polenta")'.
The `LoadPackage' command is described in Section~"ref:LoadPackage"
in the {\GAP} Reference Manual.
