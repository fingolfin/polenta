\Section{Polycyclic presentations of matrix groups}
 
Groups defined by polycyclic presentations are called PcpGroups in
{\GAP}.
We refer to the Polycyclic manual \cite{polycyclic} for further
background.

Suppose that a collection $X$ of
matrices of $GL(d,R)$ is given, where the ring $R$ 
is either $\Q,\Z$ or a finite field.  Let $G= \< X >$. 
If the group $G$ is polycyclic, then the
following functions determine a PcpGroup isomorphic to $G$.
 
\> PcpGroupByMatGroup( <G> )

<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where $R=\Q,\Z $ or $\F_q$.
If <G> is polycyclic, then 
this function determines a PcpGroup isomorphic to <G>. 
If <G> is not polycyclic, then there are two cases. If $R=\Z$ or $\F_q$,
then the algorithm returns 'fail'. If $R=\Q$ then the algorithm may
return 'fail' or may not terminate. 

\> IsomorphismPcpGroup( <G> )
 
<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where $R=\Q,\Z $ or $\F_q$.
If <G> is polycyclic, then 
this function determines  an isomorphism
onto a PcpGroup. 
If <G> is not polycyclic, then there are two cases. If $R=\Z$ or $\F_q$,
then the algorithm returns 'fail'. If $R=\Q$ then the algorithm may
return 'fail' or may not terminate. 

Note that the method `IsomorphismPcpGroup', 
installed in this package, cannot be
applied directly to a group given by the function `AlmostCrystallographicGroup'.
Please use  `POL_AlmostCrystallographicGroup' (with the same
parameters as `AlmostCrystallographicGroup') instead. 

\> Image( <map> ) 
\> ImageElm( <map>, <elm> )
\> ImagesSet( <map>, <elms> )
\> PreImage( <map>, <pcpelm> )
 
Here <map> is an isomorphism from a polycyclic matrix group <G>
onto a PcpGroup <H> calculated
by `IsomorphismPcpGroup(<G>)'.
These functions can be used to compute with such an isomorphism. 
If the input <elm>  is an element of <G>, then the function `ImageElm'
 can be used to compute the image of <elm> under <map>. 
If <elm> is not contained in <G>
then the function `ImageElm' returns 'fail'. 
The input <pcpelm> is an element
of <H>. 

\> IsSolvableGroup( <G> )
%\> IsSolvableMatGroup( <G> )

<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where $R=\Q,\Z $ or $\F_q$.
This function tests if <G> is
solvable and returns 'true' or 'false'. 

\> IsPolycyclicMatGroup( <G> )

<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where $R=\Q,\Z $ or $\F_q$.
 This function tries to test if <G> is polycyclic. If <G> is polycyclic,
 then it returns 'true'. 
If <G> is not polycyclic, then there are two cases. If $R=\Z$ or $\F_q$,
then the function returns 'false'. If  $R=\Q$ then the algorithm may
return 'false' or may not terminate.

\Section{Module series}

Let $G$ be a finitely generated solvable subgroup of $GL(d,\Q)$. The vector
space $\Q^d$ is a module for the algebra $\Q[G]$. The following
functions provide the possibility to compute certain module series of
$\Q^d$. Recall that the radical $Rad_G(\Q^d)$ is defined to be the
intersection of maximal $\Q[G]$-submodules of $\Q^d$. Also recall that the
radical series 
$$
0=R_n \< R_{n-1} \< \dots \< R_1 \< R_0=\Q^d 
$$
is defined by $R_{i+1}:= Rad_G(R_i)$. 

\> RadicalSeriesSolvableMatGroup( <G> )

This function returns a 
radical series for the $\Q[G]$-module $\Q^d$, where <G> is an
solvable subgroup of $GL(d,\Q)$.

A radical series of $\Q^d$ can be refined to a homogeneous series.

\> HomogeneousSeriesAbelianMatGroup( <G> )

A module is said to be homogeneous if it is the direct sum of pairwise
irreducible isomorphic submodules. A homogeneous series of a module 
is a submodule series such that the factors are homogeneous.
This function returns a 
homogeneous series for the $\Q[G]$-module $\Q^d$, where <G> is an
abelian subgroup of $GL(d,\Q)$.  

A homogeneous series can be refined to a composition series.

\> CompositionSeriesAbelianMatGroup( <G> )

A composition series of a module is a submodule series such that 
the factors are irreducible. This function returns a 
composition series for the $\Q[G]$-module $\Q^d$, where <G> is an
abelian subgroup of $GL(d,\Q)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Subgroups}

\> TriangNormalSubgroupFiniteInd( <G> )

<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,\Q)$. If $G$ is solvable then
this function computes a triangularizable normal subgroup of <G>,
which is of finite index in <G>. If $G$ is not solvable, then the 
function returns 'fail'. 

\> TriangNormalSubgroupFiniteIndUnipo( <G> )

<G> is  a subgroup of $GL(d,R)$ where $R=\Q$ or $\Z$.
If <G> is polycyclic, then 
this function determines a triangularizable normal subgroup $T$ of <G>,
which is of finite index in <G>. An unipotent normal 
subgroup $U$ of <G> is also
computed, such that $T/U$ is abelian.  
If <G> is not polycyclic, then there are two cases. If $R=\Z$,
then the algorithm returns 'fail'. In case that $R=\Q$ then the algorithm may
return 'fail' or may not terminate.

\Section{Examples}

\> PolExamples( <l> )
 
Returns some examples for polycyclic rational matrix groups, where <l> 
is an integer
between 1 and 24. 
These can be used to test the functions in this package. 
Some of the
properties of the examples are summarised in the following table.
