\Chapter{Information Messages}

It is possible to get informations about the status of the computation of the 
functions of Chapter 2 of this manual.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Info Class}

\> InfoPolenta
 
is the Info class of the {\Polenta} package (for more details on the Info mechanism see Section~"ref:Info Functions" of the 
{\GAP} Reference Manual). 
With the help of the function 
`SetInfoLevel(InfoPolenta,<level>)' you can change 
the info level of `InfoPolenta'. 
\beginlist
\item{--}
  If  `InfoLevel( InfoPolenta )' is equal to 0 
 then no information 
  messages are displayed. 
\item{--}
  If `InfoLevel( InfoPolenta )' is equal to 1 then basic informations
  about the process are provided. For further background on the displayed 
  informations we refer to  \cite{Assmann} (publicly available via the 
  Internet address `http://cayley.math.nat.tu-bs.de/software/assmann/').
\item{--}
  If `InfoLevel( InfoPolenta )' is equal to 2 then, in addition to the 
  basic information, the generators of computed subgroups and module series
  are displayed. 
\endlist
