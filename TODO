* Rewrite documentation using GAPDoc
* update documentation to match latest reality
* make package release
* check copyright data
* add GPL headers to files as appropriate
* Consider removing "documentation" for methods like ImageElm, IsSolvableGroup
  or at least rewrite it to make clear that what Polenta does
  is providing a new *method* for these, but that the functions
  themselves are part of GAP...


* PolExamples(14) is buggy, triggers an error?!?
  But in a new test, it did work (in GAP 4.5). Huh?
    # FIXME: The following group triggers an error in IsomorphismPcpGroup
    # when passing it to POL_Test_AllFunctions_PRMGroup.
        return POL_AlmostCrystallographicGroup( 4, 13, [-2,0,-2,-2,-1,-1] );

* Implement IsTriangularizableMatGroup for FFE groups?

* Update unit tests
